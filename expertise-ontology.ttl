Concepts differ from topics in that they represent specific instances, they may have properties describing their various features and attributes, and they can have subclasses that represent concepts that are more specific than the superclass. Topics represent an area of discourse, useful for annotating distributed content (instances and even classes) in a KG for search and summarization purposes." ,

Patterns such as the Scientific Taxonomy Pattern (https://github.com/shirlysteph/scientific-taxonomy-pattern) alongside vocabularies like SKOS and PROV to construct the hierarchy by describing appropriate relations between individual topics." .
